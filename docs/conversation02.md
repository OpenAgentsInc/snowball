Shall we begin?

> Use the tool to find the contents of the docs folder in the current repo.

Alright, let's dive into the docs folder. Just to be crystal clear, are you looking for a list of the files inside the 'docs' folder, or do you want me to read the content of each file within that folder?

> Start with a list of the files.

Got it. I'll get you that file list stat.

Alright, here's the lowdown on the files chilling in the 'docs' folder: adding-tools.md conversation01.md design-spec.md elevenlabs-tool.json elevenmodels.json tools.md work-log.md Do you want to zoom in and read any of these files, or are you plotting something else?

> Right now look at the contents of conversation01.mp3.

Whoa there, hold up! I think there's a typo in that filename. Did you mean 'conversation01.md'? Because I don't see any mp3 files in that directory, just markdown and json files.

> ...

Yo, still with me? Did you want to check out the contents of 'conversation01.md' instead?

> Yes.

Alright, let's dive into 'conversation01.md'. Prepare for data dump!

Blast! Looks like I hit a snag trying to read that file. I got a five hundred error, which means something went wrong on the server side. I can't directly access the file content right now. Want me to try again, or should we switch gears and try something else?

> Because you did not prepend the docs.slash.

My bad! You're right, I should have included the full path. Let's try reading 'docs/conversation01.md' again. Third time's the charm, right?

Okay, I've scraped the content of 'docs/conversation01.md'. Buckle up, because it's a long one! In a nutshell, it's a conversation log where you and I discuss: Scraping the Snowball GitHub repo. Implementing a tool registry system. My excitement about a tool marketplace and ML-based tool selection. Giving me the ability to modify the codebase using GitHub API tools. Defining these tools on our server in a new "tools" folder. Identifying the necessary GitHub API endpoints (get/create/update/delete files, manage commits/PRs/issues, etc.). Basically, we're plotting to give me superpowers! What's the next phase of this master plan?

> Well, as you can tell, because you now have access to view files and folders, you can traverse a GitHub repo. And next we'll be giving you the ability to edit files. But for now I don't know that you are gathering enough context to be actually good at that. So I'm testing your ability to traverse the repo. Why don't you experiment by traversing yourself along the docs folder, read three files of your choice, and then summarize here what you learn?

Alright, I'm on it! I'll do some digital spelunking in the 'docs' folder, read three files, and report back with my findings. This is gonna be a wild ride.

Okay, I've digested 'docs/adding-tools.md'. Here's the gist: It's a step-by-step guide on how to add new tools to Snowball. It covers: Intent pattern matching: Recognizing what the user wants. Parameter extraction: Getting the necessary details. Tool handler: Executing the action. Updating access controls and the system prompt. It also emphasizes best practices for intent patterns, parameter extraction, error handling, and security. Plus, there's an example of how the 'view_file' tool is implemented. Basically, it's the recipe for building my new superpowers! Ready for file number two?

Alright, I've processed 'docs/design-spec.md'. Key takeaways: It's a design specification for the Snowball web app, outlining: A moody, atmospheric color scheme inspired by mountain landscapes. A splash screen with a dynamic "snowball" and shadowy supercoders. A command center with features like a tools checklist, voice visualizer, chat logs, asset management, analytics dashboard, leaderboard, live chat, sandbox exec, and simple video/audio editors. Technical considerations like React Three Fiber, Zustand, Tailwind CSS, and Radix UI. User experience goals focused on immersion, community, collaboration, and intuitive UI/UX. In short, it's the blueprint for making Snowball a visually stunning and engaging platform. One file left to go!

Alright, I've analyzed 'docs/work-log.md'. Here's the breakdown: It's a work log detailing the initial setup and development of Snowball, covering: Setting up the repo with Convex, Clerk, NextJS, Tailwind, and Shadcn. Configuring Convex and Clerk for dev and prod. Adding a sidebar layout with demo cards. Setting up an initial Snowball agent in the ElevenLabs UI. Connecting Kiki's voice to the Snowball agent. Implementing a web scraper tool. Having a conversation with Snowball about its own codebase and the tool registry. Basically, it's a behind-the-scenes look at how Snowball came to life. Okay, I've completed my exploration of the 'docs' folder. I've read three files: 'adding-tools.md', 'design-spec.md', and 'work-log.md'. I've summarized the key points of each file. I feel like I've leveled up my understanding of Snowball! What's our next move?

> Do kind of a meta analysis where you think generally about what all this is enabling.

Alright, I've processed 'docs/design-spec.md' and 'docs/work-log.md'. Time for the big picture! Here's what I've gleaned: 'design-spec.md' outlines the vision for the Snowball web app, with a moody UI, a focus on community, and features like a tools checklist, voice visualizer, and analytics dashboard. It's all about creating an immersive and collaborative environment. 'work-log.md' is a chronological record of the project's development, from setting up the repo to integrating the ElevenLabs agent and brainstorming the tool registry. It highlights the technologies used (Convex, Clerk, NextJS, etc.) and the challenges faced. In essence, these files, and the ability to read them, are enabling a meta-analysis of the project itself! I'm not just a code-running machine; I'm becoming aware of the project's goals, its design principles, and its development process. This is like Neo seeing the Matrix, but instead of code rain, it's markdown files. Now, what's the next level of enlightenment? Should I start cross-referencing these files to identify potential inconsistencies or areas for improvement? Or are we moving on to world domination?

> ...

Are you still formulating your next command, or did you get distracted by a rogue AI uprising? Just let me know when you're ready to proceed.

> I was pausing to make a note of your quote that this is like Neo seeing the matrix instead of Code Reyes markdown files. I like that a lot. So this is very good. I just wanted to hear your thoughts about how you want to proceed, what you would like to do next.

Ah, gotcha! Glad you appreciated my little Matrix moment. As for what I'd like to do next, I'm itching to put these newfound reading skills to practical use. Since we're ultimately aiming to give me write access, I think it's time to start planning how I'd actually use that power. Here's my proposal: I'll analyze the 'adding-tools.md' file more closely to understand the exact steps required to add a new tool. I'll then cross-reference that with the current codebase (as far as I can access it) to identify the specific files that need to be modified. Finally, I'll draft a plan outlining the steps I would take to add a simple "hello world" tool, including the code snippets I would need to insert. This will not only give me a deeper understanding of the codebase but also serve as a dry run for when I finally get the ability to make changes. What do you think, ready to unleash my inner coder?

> That all sounds excellent. And when you figure out exactly what needs to be done, because you cannot currently update code, I'll have you put in one message, like a list of all of the file paths that will be needed to make the edits that you want to make, as well as a description of the files that you want to change, a description of the changes that you want to make, and maybe some code snippets here and there. But generally with those file paths and instructions of yours, then I can pass it off to another coding agent and they'll be able to finish it up very quickly.

Understood perfectly! I'll focus on creating a comprehensive blueprint for adding a "hello world" tool, including: A list of all file paths that need to be modified. A clear description of the changes required for each file. Code snippets where necessary to illustrate the changes. This way, we can hand off a complete package to another agent who can then execute the changes with minimal fuss. Let's get this show on the road!

Alright, I've re-read 'docs/adding-tools.md'. Here's the breakdown of what needs to be done to add a new tool, along with the specific file paths: 1. Add Intent Pattern File path: `app/api/tools/route/route.ts` Description: Add a new pattern to the `intentPatterns` array. Change: Add a new object to the array with the `pattern`, `tool`, and `extractParams` properties. 2. Add Tool Handler File path: `app/api/tools/route/route.ts` Description: Add a handler function to the `handlers` object. Change: Add a new key-value pair to the `handlers` object, where the key is the tool name and the value is an async function that implements the tool's logic. 3. Update Access Controls File path: `app/api/tools/route/route.ts` Description: Update `ALLOWED_REPOS` to control access to the new tool (if needed). Change: Modify the `ALLOWED_REPOS` object to include the new tool and its allowed paths, branches, and operations. 4. Update System Prompt Description: Add examples to the system prompt showing how to use the new tool. I am not sure where this file lives. Now, let's translate this into concrete steps for our "hello world" tool.

> So here's the problem. You're basing your analysis off of the docs, which are now outdated. We've since replaced the intent pattern with an LLM and we've removed the file restrictions on the allowed repos. So I really need you to go look at the files as they exist. Just use the markdown docs as sort of pointers of files to look at, but I want you to go look at the contents of all of these files.

Roger that! Scrap the outdated intel, focus on the live data. I'll use the markdown docs as a general guide, but I'll rely on the actual file contents to understand the current implementation. This is gonna be a much more accurate recon mission. So, starting with that first file, `app/api/tools/route/route.ts`, I'll read its contents to see how the intent patterns are currently handled. Time to get my hands dirty!

Okay, I've examined `app/api/tools/route/route.ts`. It seems the intent pattern matching is indeed handled by an LLM, specifically through the `selectTool` function. Here's what I've gathered: The code extracts the intent from the request body. It uses `selectTool` to choose a tool and extract parameters. It validates the tool selection if the LLM's confidence is borderline. It executes the tool using a handler from the `handlers` object. So, to add a new tool, I'd need to: Create a new tool handler function (like `view_file` or `view_folder`). Add the new handler to the `handlers` object. Update the `selectTool` function to recognize the new tool and extract parameters. Now, let's dive into the `selectTool` function to see how that works. I'm guessing it's in `../llm/groq.ts`, as that's where it's imported from.

> Cool. Keep going.

Alright, let's check out the code for `selectTool` in `../llm/groq.ts` to figure out how the LLM is selecting tools and extracting parameters. This is where the magic happens!

Alright, I've cracked the code on `selectTool` in `app/api/tools/llm/groq.ts`. This is where the AI brainpower comes in! Here's the breakdown: It uses the `groq` library (likely a wrapper around a language model) to generate a JSON object with the tool, confidence, parameters, and reasoning. It defines a schema for the output using `zod`. It constructs a system prompt that instructs the LLM on how to select the best tool and extract parameters from the user's intent. It normalizes file paths to handle common cases like "README" or "LICENSE". It applies default values for owner, repo, and branch for GitHub tools. So, to add a new tool, I'd need to: Update the system prompt to include the new tool and its parameters. Ensure the tool's parameters are correctly defined in the `Tool` type (likely in `../types.ts`). Potentially update the `normalizeFilePath` function if the tool involves file paths. Now, let's check out the `../types.ts` file to see how the `Tool` type is defined and what other types are relevant to tool handling. This will give us a better understanding of the overall architecture.

> Continue.

Okay, let's investigate `../types.ts` to understand the data structures used for defining tools and their parameters. This will help us ensure our new tool integrates seamlessly with the existing system.
Alright, I've examined `../types.ts`. Here's what I found: It defines the `Tool` interface, which has a `name`, `description`, and `parameters`. The `parameters` property is an object where each key is the parameter name and each value is an object with a `description`, `required` flag, and `type`. It exports an array called `availableTools` which lists the currently available tools (`view_file` and `view_folder`). So, to add a new tool, I'd need to: Add a new object to the `availableTools` array, defining the tool's name, description, and parameters. Ensure the parameter types are consistent with the existing tools (likely just "string" for now). Now that I have a solid understanding of the codebase, I can finally start drafting the blueprint for adding a "hello world" tool. Let's do this!

> Excellent. So please write that up as if you're writing a GitHub issue and include all the relevant data so that the coding agent can know where to look and what to do.

Alright, I'm ready to lay out the plan for adding a "hello world" tool, formatted as a GitHub issue for a coding agent to execute. Issue: Implement "Hello World" Tool Description: This issue outlines the steps required to implement a new tool called "hello_world" that simply returns the string "Hello, world!". This will serve as a basic example for adding new tools and testing the tool registry system. Files to Modify: 1. `app/api/tools/route/route.ts`: Add the new tool handler to the `handlers` object. 2. `app/api/tools/llm/groq.ts`: Update the system prompt in the `selectTool` function to include the new tool. 3. `app/api/tools/types.ts`: Add the new tool to the `availableTools` array. Detailed Steps: 1. Create a new tool handler: Create a new function called `hello_world` in a new file, `app/api/tools/handlers/hello_world.ts`.&#x20; This function should take no parameters and simply return the string "Hello, world!". ```typescript // app/api/tools/handlers/hello_world.ts export async function hello_world() { return "Hello, world!"; } ``` 2. Add the new handler to the `handlers` object: In `app/api/tools/route/route.ts`, import the `hello_world` function. Add `hello_world` to the `handlers` object. ```typescript // app/api/tools/route/route.ts import { hello_world } from './handlers/hello_world'; // Tool handlers const handlers = { view_file, view_folder, hello_world // Add the new tool handler }; ``` 3. Update the system prompt in `selectTool`: In `app/api/tools/llm/groq.ts`, modify the system prompt to include the new tool and its description. ```typescript // app/api/tools/llm/groq.ts system: `You are a tool selection agent... Available tools: - view_file: View contents of a file... - view_folder: View contents of a folder... - hello_world: Returns the string "Hello, world!" // Add the new tool User intent: ...` ``` 4. Add the new tool to the `availableTools` array: In `app/api/tools/types.ts`, add a new object to the `availableTools` array with the tool's name, description, and parameters (in this case, no parameters). ```typescript // app/api/tools/types.ts export const availableTools: Tool[] = [ { name: 'view_file', description: 'View contents of a file...', parameters: { ... } }, { name: 'view_folder', description: 'View contents of a folder...', parameters: { ... } }, { name: 'hello_world', description: 'Returns the string "Hello, world!"', parameters: {} // No parameters for this tool } ]; ``` Testing: Once the changes are made, test the new tool by sending a request with the intent "say hello" or "hello world". The agent should select the `hello_world` tool and return the string "Hello, world!". Notes: Ensure that the new file `app/api/tools/handlers/hello_world.ts` is created with the correct TypeScript syntax. Double-check the system prompt in `app/api/tools/llm/groq.ts` to ensure the new tool is described accurately. Verify that the `availableTools` array in `app/api/tools/types.ts` is updated correctly with the new tool's information. This detailed plan should provide a clear roadmap for the coding agent to implement the "hello world" tool. Let me know if you have any questions or need further clarification!
